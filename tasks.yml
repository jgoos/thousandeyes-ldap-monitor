  name: "Extend Response Type Handling"
  context: |
    The script currently handles 0x65, 0x64, 0x82 and 0x06. LDAP also defines SearchResultReference (0x73) and intermediateResponse. We need graceful handling for those tags.
  prompt: |-
    In the section that switches on `responseType = buffer[8]`, add cases to:
      1. Detect tag 0x73 (SearchResultReference) and skip over its TLV using `parseBerLength`, continuing the scan.
      2. Detect intermediateResponse (0x79) and treat it as non-fatal (skip).
      3. For unknown but valid LDAP tags (context-specific 0xA0â€“0xBF), skip their TLV instead of throwing.
      4. Keep the additional code under 1 KB to respect the overall character budget.
